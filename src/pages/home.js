              <p>
                I've always been interested in programming since the day I
                signed up on Myspace in 2004 or that time I chose a career as a
                programmer in The Sims 3. Being a kid in the 90â€™s also means I
                was able to witness the rapid evolution of the Internet from its
                early days. It has always fascinated me.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2019, I realized that I could turn my interest into a
                professional career by completing a{" "}
                <strong>Full-Stack Web Development</strong> boot camp with Le
                Wagon. I have since been working as a{" "}
                <strong>Web Integrator / Front-end developer</strong> for the
                past 4 years, where I focused on creating responsive designs and
                optimizing website performance. I take pride in my attention to
                detail and strive to ensure that every element of a website is
                not only functional and intuitive but also aesthetically
                pleasing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite working in the industry, I recently obtained a
                certificate as a <strong>Front-end Developer</strong> from
                SheCodes, highlighting my dedication to continuous learning and
                staying updated with the latest technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, with four years of experience as a Web Integrator /
                Front-end developer under my belt, I've decided to embark on the
                path of freelancing. As an{" "}
                <strong>
                  independent Front-end developer and WordPress developer
                </strong>
                , I leverage my skills to create websites that are both
                aesthetically pleasing and functional. I am passionate about
                collaborating with diverse clients and bringing their visions to
                digital reality.

                Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy playing with my dog
                and exploring the outdoors with him, immersing myself in
                captivating manga reads, and occasionally getting lost in the
                realm of video games.

                      specializing in WordPress. My contributions spanned a wide

                      wireframe to design and integration, to constructing

                      of addressing security concerns and ensuring timely

                      extended beyond mere frontend development, encompassing
